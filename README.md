# Daniel-Mod5-Final-Project
# Recommendation Systems

## Introduction:

Used the dataset from worldometers.com for most up to data on COVID19 cases in the US
https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/country/us

Used Yelp Dataset (200,000 businesses, millions of reviews & users)

https://www.yelp.com/dataset

## Objective:
 
To predict the ratings of Yelp Businesses and create a recommendation system for localized travel and things to do incorporating COVID-19 elements

## The Dataset:

* WorldOMeters
* Yelp

## Skills Required to Complete:

The skills used to complete this project consisted of:

* Working with Python to make visualizations using Matplotlib & Seaborn
* Using Pandas to collect and clean the dataset
* Using BeatuifulSoup to webscrape COVID19 Data
* Building & interpreting various regression models based on RMSE scores & hyperparameter tuning

## What Was Posted on GitHub:

Currently one notebook posted on GitHub. The Final Project notebook which consisted of the Data Cleaning, Collection & Modeling components of the supervised machine learning, the ReadMe notebook which is a layout of how our project was presented, png files for visuals.

## Questions That Were Posed:

* What kind of categories are the most common in the YELP data set
* Which states would be the safest to visit based on the COVID19 data
* What are some ways that businesses are adapting to COVID19

## How the Data Was Put Together:

The data was gathered from over 200,000 different businesses from the Yelp data set. Following that, the data was cleaned and supplemented with feature engineering. After EDA was performed to see which features had any statistical relationships with one another. Next the data set was put through various regression models to predict star ratings. In addition, webscrapping was pulled from world0meters.com to incorporate relevant COVID19 data. 

## Future Steps:

* To incorporate 3 different recommendation systems with the current data set (collaborative, content, hybrid)
* Create a frontend user interface through DASH

## Recommendation Based on Analysis:

TBD after recommendation systems are complete
